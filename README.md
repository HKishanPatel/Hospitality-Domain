# Hospitality Power BI Project
This is a Power BI project focused on the hospitality domain. It provides valuable insights and visualizations to analyze and monitor various aspects of the hospitality industry. The project leverages the capabilities of Power BI to transform raw data into meaningful and interactive reports and dashboards.

Project Overview
The Hospitality Power BI Project aims to provide comprehensive data analysis and visualization solutions for the hospitality industry. It includes a set of pre-built reports and dashboards designed to address common challenges and metrics within this domain.

Key features of the project:
Revenue: Calculate the total revenue realized by aggregating the revenue from all bookings. This metric provides an overview of the financial performance of the hospitality establishment.

Occupancy: Measure the occupancy rate by calculating the ratio of successful bookings to the total available rooms (capacity). This metric helps assess the utilization of room inventory and indicates the popularity of the establishment.

ADR (Average Daily Rate): Calculate the average daily rate by dividing the total revenue by the number of rooms booked/sold. ADR represents the average price paid for each room sold and helps evaluate pricing strategies and revenue potential.

Realization: Calculate the realization percentage by determining the ratio of successfully checked-out bookings to all bookings. This metric measures the effectiveness of the booking process and provides insights into the fulfillment of customer reservations.

DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): Determine the number of sellable rooms for each day by considering a specific time period. DSRN helps assess the availability of rooms for sale on a daily basis and supports revenue forecasting and capacity planning.

RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): Calculate the revenue generated per available room, whether occupied or not. RevPAR enables hotels to evaluate their revenue performance and make pricing decisions. It also facilitates benchmarking against other properties or brands.
